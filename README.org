*** Score

Club members score other's proposals. Top-scoring proposals are tracked and visible.

When a meeting is scheduled, the organizer (meeting "leader") chooses several proposals from the top-scoring pool of papers to serve as candidates for the upcoming meeting. Club members vote on these candidates to select to the group reading for the meeting.
